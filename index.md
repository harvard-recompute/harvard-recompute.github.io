## Our Mission

We aim to cultivate an interdisciplinary undergraduate community for critically examining and improving structures for responsible tech use in society.

## Why ReCompute

In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in technology use across all sectors, especially adoption of AI tools in areas like government and education. As more tools like LLMs that directly rely on and have an immediate effect on individuals become ubiquitous, fostering responsible tech use is crucial for navigating our tech-centric future with ethical integrity. However, there is currently a lack of transparency in the field of responsible tech for those who want to get involved, particularly for undergraduate students.

Accessibility is at the core of our work. We welcome students across a diverse range of disciplines to engage in responsible-tech research, advocacy, and education collaboratively. We believe that involving undergraduates is pivotal for the growth of the responsible tech movement.
